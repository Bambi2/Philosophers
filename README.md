# Philophers
In this project I learned the basics of multithreading. I saw how to use threads and mutexes. 
## Description
This project represents the dining philosophers problem which is often used in concurrent algorithm design to\
illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them.
## Usage
```
./philo *number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep \[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat\]*
```
## Example
